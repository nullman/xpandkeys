* XpandKeys

XpandKeys is an X daemon that converts abbreviations into longer strings of
text which replace them as the users types.  It works independently of the
window manager and desktop environment.  It was inspired by the TypeIt4Me
program that the Author used on Mac OS 7.  It works similarly to Xbindkeys and
sxhkd, and uses similar input processing techniques.
