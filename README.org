* XpandKeys

  XpandKeys is an X daemon that converts abbreviations into longer strings of
  text which replace them as the users types under X. It works independently of
  the window manager and desktop environment. It was inspired by the Mac OS 6/7
  TypeIt4Me program. It works similarly to Xbindkeys and sxhkd, including using
  similar input processing techniques.
